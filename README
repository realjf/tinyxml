This is simply a copy of TinyXML by Lee Thomason based at <http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/>

This is not intended to be the official source of the library, but
rather a convienent repo based at GitHub.  The library hasn't changed
since 2007 years so there is little active development.

#### New Feature

- add TiXmlElement::HasAttribute(const char* name) function
- add CMakeLists.txt
